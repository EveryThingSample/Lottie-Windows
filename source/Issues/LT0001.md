<!-- description -->
Rectangle shape cannot be rendered when its Size is animated and Trim Paths applied.

## Remarks

<!-- notes  -->
The exact behavior from AfterEffects cannot easily be translated when a Rectangle's Size is animated and TrimPaths applied. Consider converting the Rectangle to a Path instead.
